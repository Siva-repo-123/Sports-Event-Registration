The code you provided is a React component called SportsEnroll. It is responsible for rendering a table where users can enroll participants for sports events and calculate the total entry fee.

Let's go through the code step by step:

import React, { useState } from 'react';
The code imports the React library and the useState hook from React. This allows you to use state and state updates in a functional component.

Defining the SportsEnroll component:

const SportsEnroll = () => {
  // Component code goes here
};
The code defines a functional component named SportsEnroll. Functional components are a way to write React components using JavaScript functions.

//Initializing state using the useState hook

const [participants, setParticipants] = useState([
  { id: 1, name: '', sport: '', entryFee: '' },
]);

The useState hook is used to declare a state variable named participants and a function named setParticipants to update the state. The initial state is set to an array containing one participant object with empty values for name, sport, and entryFee.

//Handling input changes:

const handleInputChange = (index, event) => {
  const { name, value } = event.target;
  const updatedParticipants = [...participants];
  updatedParticipants[index] = { ...updatedParticipants[index], [name]: value };
  setParticipants(updatedParticipants);
};

This function is triggered when an input field is changed. It extracts the name and value from the input field's event and creates a copy of the participants array. The specific participant at the given index is updated with the new value for the corresponding name. Finally, the setParticipants function is called to update the state with the modified participants array.

//Handling sport selection changes:

const handleSportChange = (index, event) => {
  const { value } = event.target;
  const updatedParticipants = [...participants];
  updatedParticipants[index] = { ...updatedParticipants[index], sport: value };

  if (value === 'cricket') {
    updatedParticipants[index] = { ...updatedParticipants[index], entryFee: '300' };
  } else if (value === 'badminton') {
    updatedParticipants[index] = { ...updatedParticipants[index], entryFee: '150' };
  } else {
    updatedParticipants[index] = { ...updatedParticipants[index], entryFee: '' };
  }
  setParticipants(updatedParticipants);
};

This function is called when a sport selection is changed. It updates the sport value of the participant at the specified index in the participants array. Additionally, based on the selected sport, it sets the corresponding entryFee value. If the value is 'cricket', the entry fee is set to '300', if it's 'badminton', the entry fee is set to '150', otherwise, the entry fee is set to an empty string. Finally, the state is updated with the modified participants array.

//Adding a new row:

const handleAddRow = () => {
  setParticipants((prevParticipants) => [
    ...prevParticipants,
    { id: prevParticipants.length + 1, name: '', sport: '', entryFee: '' },
  ]);
};

This function is called when the user clicks the "Add Row" button. It adds a new participant row to the participants array by creating a copy of the previous participants using the spread operator (...prevParticipants). A new participant object is appended to the copied array, with a unique id based on the length of the previous participants array and empty values for name, sport, and entryFee. Finally, the state is updated with the new participants array.

//Deleting a row:

const handleDeleteRow = (index) => {
  setParticipants((prevParticipants) =>
    prevParticipants.filter((_, i) => i !== index)
  );
};

This function is called when the user clicks the "X" button to delete a row. It filters the participants array, excluding the participant at the specified index. The state is then updated with the filtered participants array.

//Calculating the total price:

const calculateTotalPrice = () => {
  let totalPrice = 0;
  participants.forEach((participant) => {
    const { entryFee } = participant;
    if (entryFee) {
      totalPrice += parseInt(entryFee);
    }
  });
  return totalPrice;
};

This function calculates the total price of all participants' entry fees. It iterates over each participant in the participants array, checks if the entryFee exists, and if so, adds its integer value to the totalPrice variable. Finally, the total price is returned.

//Rendering the component:

return (
  <div className="container">
    {/ ...component JSX goes here /}
  </div>
);

The component's render method returns JSX, which represents the structure and content of the component's UI. In this case, a div container is rendered, enclosing two table elements. The first table displays the participant rows, including input fields for name, a sport selection dropdown, entry fee input, and a delete button. The second table shows the total number of participants and the calculated total price, with an "Add Row" button.
